Themes site: https://themes.gohugo.io/

Theme I used for the demo : https://github.com/coderzh/hugo-pacman-theme

### Cloning the theme from GitHub

From terminal:

```
cd yoursitename
git clone https://github.com/coderzh/hugo-pacman-theme.git themes\hugo-pacman-theme\
rm -recurse -force themes\hugo-pacman-theme\.git

# Or on Mac/Linux
rm -rf themes\hugo-pacman-theme\.git
```

Then configure `config.toml` to make the theme happy, as seen in the video
